# Getting and Cleaning Data. Week-4. Project

A dataset from [here](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip)
was given. Details of the dataset is [here](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones). Give a 
look at the dataset.

## Steps:
##########################################
Follow the steps for processing the dataset
* Open a project
* Download the zipped dataset from link given above
* Unzip the zip file
* Set working directory to the forled after unzip (UCI HAR Dataset)
* Run the run_analysis.R script
* You will get a tidy dataset.

## About the script:
##########################################
* Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
* Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
* Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
* Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
* From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each 
variable for each activity and each subject.
